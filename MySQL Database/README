MYSQL DOCKER INSTRUCTIONS

Inside this folder you will find a data.sql file and a Dockerfile. These need to stay in the same folder to work.

DATA.SQL FILE

This contains the data to setup the userAccounts table in the lottery MySQL database which will run in a Docker image.

The userAccounts table is populated with one user account for you.

You can insert more user accounts in the file if you wish but don't change the userAccounts table!


DOCKERFILE

This will setup and run the lottery MySQL database for you and create the table and the data defined in the data.sql file.

The file should work as it is without any alterations needed.

There are two stages to setting the database up: build and run

1. Build

- first open a terminal at the MySQL Database folder
- execute the build command:

>> docker build -t="<docker account name here>/lotterydb .

2. Run

- execute the run command:

>> docker run -d -p 33333:3306 --name lotteryDB <docker account name here>/lotterydb

- you should get an output similar to below which is the docker image ID:

>> a75606af8fc6c02dd79a112a8feeb6ff674ab0c31a4b0d87cc4af4d34dea8e08



CONNECTING TO DOCKER IMAGE

You will need to use the following URL in your Java code if running a local tomcat server on your computer and MySQL in Docker. This needs to be used in all your Java Servlets which are connecting to the mysql database

String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:33333/lottery";



STOPPING THE DOCKER IMAGE

When you have finished using the image it is best to stop and remove the image (note that any database content added whilst running will be lost)

>> docker stop lotterydb

>> docker rm lotterydb

>> docker image rm <docker account name here>/lotterydb
